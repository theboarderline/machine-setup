# CloudWalk NeoVim Configuration

This is a configuration for NeoVim that is designed to be used with the CloudWalk development environment.
It includes a variety of plugins and settings to enhance the development experience. It is designed to be
lightweight and fast, while still providing a rich set of features put-of-the-box similar to those found in modern IDEs
like the [JetBrains Suite](https://www.jetbrains.com/) and [Cursor](https://cursor.so/) (RIP VSCode) while attempting to
preserve the classic Vim muscle memory.

### Features
- Intuitive and classic keybindings that are still customizable
- LSP (Language Server Protocol) support for more languages than you probably need
- Syntax highlighting (defaults to Monokai)
- File explorer
- Standard Autocompletion
- AI Autocompletion
- Snippets
- Debugging support
- Fuzzy finder (keywork, files, buffers, etc.)
- Status line
- Terminal integration
- LazyGit integration
- K9s integration
- Cursor-like plugin

### WIP
This configuration is a work in progress and is not yet complete. It is feature rich and much of it works out of the box and is easily
customizable, but there are still some features that need to be added or improved. The goal is to make this configuration
easy to use and customize, while allowing some sort of release cycle to be followed.


###TODO:
- Multiple cursors add extra character or its off on subsequest lines
- Double icons in gutter sometimes
- Improve dynamic configurations
- Improve DAP experience
- Python
    - Too many tabs on enter in Python
    - Python LSP not registering venv
    - Activate venv if it exists
- Rust error
